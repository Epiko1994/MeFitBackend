## Background

The MeFit backend is set up to expose the PostgreSQL database via a RESTful JPA and Hibernate
API.

The backend is deployed on Heroku.

The API consists of several controllers exposing individual endpoints producing and accepting
JSON input and outputs

### Java
#### Curlies go on line with the method declaration

`public static void main(String[] args) {}`
